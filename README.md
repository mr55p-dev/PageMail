# PageSaver

## Routes to add:

- DELETE: Delete a user
- UPDATE: Change user info
- UPDATE: User preferences
- DELETE: Delete a post for a user

## Roadmap:

- Make the shortcuts display the website title.
- Add user permissions.
- Check the ability to set a custom token duration.
- Add a worker which sends emails, and marks pages as sent and unsent.
- Add a worker which gets metadata for each page saved and stores it in a table.
- Set up a domain, and a light frontend in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
